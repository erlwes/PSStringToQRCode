1. Test path and extension by using a parameter validation script for the save output parameter.
2. After closing form, some anoying output is returned to console. I have tried to [void], | Out-null and .Dispose() alot of stuff, but the output persists. Figure it out?
3. Set property so that main form i not resizeable.
4. It does not make sense to ask for both height and width parameters as output should be 1:1 between these two. Merge into one parameter names size maybe?
5. ...?
