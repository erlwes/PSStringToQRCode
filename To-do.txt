Notes:

1. Test path and extension by using a parameter validation script for the save output parameter.
2. Set property so that main form i not resizeable.
4. It does not make sense to ask for both height and width parameters as output should be 1:1 between these two. Merge into one parameter names size maybe?
5. Improve error-handling and add -verbose to see what actually is happening. As a minimum say if image was saved successfully or not.
